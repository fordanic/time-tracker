# Feature Requirements

This document records additional feature requirements that have been selected
for implementation. It is subordinate to
[Top-Level Requirements](top-level-requirements.md) and
[Architecture](architecture.md), which are the authoritative product and technical
documents. A feature requirement must conform to both and cannot override either
one.

The [competitive assessment and TUI roadmap](competitive-assessment.md) is
planning input. A candidate from that assessment belongs here only after it has
been selected for implementation.

## Requirements workflow

For each selected feature:

1. Define its user-visible behavior, invariants, error handling, and acceptance
   criteria in this document before implementation.
2. Update [Top-Level Requirements](top-level-requirements.md) first, or in the
   same change, if the feature changes a durable product rule, quality constraint,
   or product boundary.
3. Update [Architecture](architecture.md) first, or in the same change, if the
   feature changes a technical choice or boundary.
4. Implement and test the feature against the approved requirements.

## Approved feature requirements

No additional feature requirements have been approved yet.

## Feature specification template

Use this structure when a feature is selected. Replace the placeholder rather
than treating the template as an approved requirement.

### Feature name

**Status:** Approved | Implemented

#### Purpose

State the user problem and intended outcome.

#### Required behavior

- Describe observable behavior and supported TUI interactions.

#### Invariants and error handling

- Describe rules that must always hold and how rejected actions are reported.

#### Acceptance criteria

1. State a verifiable outcome.

#### Documentation impact

- Note any corresponding change to the top-level requirements or architecture,
  or state that neither authoritative document changes.
